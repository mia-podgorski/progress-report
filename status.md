Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?
So far I have created a game loop and screen. I have sprites for the player and food displayed on the screen. The player can move using the arrow keys and the food is added randomly to the screen. When the player goes past the boundries of the screen the game is ended and a "game over" message will be displayed. I have used time.sleep to delay the exit of the screen.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not yet added the traps and added ants to the ant line. I do not have a score displayed. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
I am having a hard time figuring out the collision aspect of this specifically because I used a picture as my player. I am also having trouble randomly adding back food when the ant collides with it. My biggest problem at the moment is collisions. I can not figure out oop although I have tried to make it work with my existing code.
