#### What have you done for your project so far?
So far I have created a game loop and screen. I have sprites for the player and food. The player can move using the arrow keys and the food is added randomly to the display. When the player goes past the boundries of the screen the game is ended and a "game over" message will be displayed. I have used time.sleep to delay the exit of the screen.
